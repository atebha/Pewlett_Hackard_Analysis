# Pewlett_Hackard_Analysis

Purpose:

  Using SQL Postgres to perform an analysis of the employee data. This was done to determine the number of employees eligible for retirement. The data was than further sequenced to determine hom of this eligible retirment group was eligible for a mentorship program based on job title. This impeding exit of talent was dubbed the "silver tsunami." 
  
Analysis:

  Part of the first deliverable was to determine the count for retirees based on tiles. This allows one to determine where HR resources should be dedicated to begin mitigating and offsetting this impeding loss of talent. The second part of the deliverable was to determine which of thses impeding retirees were eligible for a mentorship program. Based on these deliverable a few conclusions can be made.
  
  - The first being a company of this size is about to lose roughly 30% of their entire labor force which is mostly made up of highly specialized skills. Since this list of retirement eligibility was based on birth date there maybe a possiblity that employees are not forced to retire at a certain age just that an employee can, which is really no different than an employee retiring now. The only impedence of a person to retire is desire, if a newly entering worker that just graduated college wins a large sum of money or gets a huge inheritence that employee can choose to retire as well. This however does expose a risk to the business that a labor shortage may occurr and such a situation should be monitored. Particularly with their employees that have the tile of senior engineer or senior staff. 
   
  - This combined group made up roughly 60% of the eligible retirement pool. There is a big risk for technical knowledge/skill to be lost while management only had 1 person eligible for retirement in the list. This person was not listed to the level of their management so it is unclear of this would be a C level retirement or just a middle management risk. This makes it difficult to assess whether this management retirement is of an equivalent risk like losing the senior engineers. 
  
  - In relation to the eligible to retire vs those eligible for mentorship there was only only 2% of the retirment pool  eligible for mentorship. This is a very small  group to be able to bring new hire up to speed and reduce the loss of technical skills and knowledge. A bigger mnetoring group should be made by easing the requirement to be a mentor as well as expanding the overall mentor numbers. 

  - A risk of this magnitude for possible retirement also implies the business has not insulated itself from other labor shocks. One being a workers strike or a possible global event that impedes workers from coming to work or said event shuting their industry to a stand still. C level management must craft a better succession paln and increase the robustness of their work force to absorb thses kinds of labor shocks. 

  Some ways to absorbs these kinds of shocks is having a pool of independant contractors, rehiring retirees as consultants as not to lose their techincal knowledge and skills. Another possible solution is start working on automating work flows, expand the intership programs to gett more new hires to asbord  the impeding techincal knowldge loss. Creating a knowldge bases to allow out going employees to store their techincal knowldge and allow new hires to refer to it. 
  
Challenges:

One of the biggest challenges was data not loading into new tables correctly or duplicate tables being created. 

Summary:

  The biggest group of the eligible retirees are senior engineers and senior staff. The rest of the retire group consistent of techincal staff, engineer and assist engineer. There i sroughly 90k retirees and only 2% of that group wouldbe doing the mentoring. It is clear from the given data set the request mentorship is not going to be enough to handle the out flux of talent and the HR team needs to be working double time in order to start a transition to reduce a disruption to business. The number of mentors to mentees would be almost a 60 to 1 ratio. Knowledge transfer at that size is very inefficent. Just ask the new hires that just left college experiencing those class sizes. The retirmentmentor program needs to be expanded to help with onbaording otherwise there will be a severe impact to the business.
